**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Having experience working as a test engineer, I have encountered various situations, whether it be flaws in the design architecture that result in significant resource losses during later stages of development, or insufficiently thought-out business requirements leading to malfunctioning applications or systems.

The latter is particularly concerning as the consequences can be dire. To minimize risks, a user data collection system was implemented with their consent. This allowed us to gather information, analyze current users and their needs, and swiftly address any emerging issues in the application. Therefore, I believe it is crucial to involve analysts and researchers in the development process, as they can offer a different perspective compared to developers or task managers. If I successfully complete this course and, most importantly, effectively apply the acquired knowledge, I would like to focus on data analysis to enhance functionality, optimize resource allocation in development, and increase general customer satisfaction.
